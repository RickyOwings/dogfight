The code here is a little bit messy. I am coding this using vite and I am going to just run with it. All of the important files are in the src/game folder anyways, so I can always just deploy it in a better way in the future... Also I am not entirely sure wether or not I like vite that much yet or if I am even using it for the correct use case.
